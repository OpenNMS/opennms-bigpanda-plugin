# OpenNMS BigPanda Plugin


This plugin was generated by the OIA archetype and is used as example project layout.


Build and install the plugin into your local Maven repository using:
```
mvn clean install
```

> OpenNMS normally runs as root, so make sure the artifacts are installed in `/root/.m2` or try making `/root/.m2` symlink to your user's repository

From the OpenNMS Karaf shell:
```
feature:repo-add mvn:org.opennms.plugins/karaf-features/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml
feature:install opennms-plugins-bigpanda
```

Update automatically:
```
bundle:watch *
```


Once installed, the plugin makes the following Karaf shell commands available:
* opennms-bigpanda:stats
* opennms-bigpanda:forward-topology

You can also access the REST endpoint mounted by the plugin at `http://nms:8980/opennms/rest/bigpanda/ping`
